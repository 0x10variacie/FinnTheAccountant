# FinnTheAccountant
A financial tool written in C#, similar to my previous projects, where the main menu with interaction with the user, financial operations, and control were introduced.

This readme file also plays a role of manual to introduce the program to developers and users.

In the beginning, the intro message is displayed. You can either press any key to proceed to the main menu or press X to shutdown the app.

MAIN MENU
Up-to-date for the v1.2:
The program includes utilites oriented to Savings and Investments.
To access Savings section, press S. Respectively, press I for Investments.
To read about program functionality, press H for Help.
To open the About tab, press A.
Ultimately, press X to exit with a choice window.

SAVINGS
Daily Expenses: type the float MONTHLY budget value and hit Enter. The utility will calculate the daily expenses through division by 30 days as a mean calendar month.

INVESTMENTS
Investment Value Calculator: the utility wizard will guide you through gathering necessary data for future and present values calculations. The data should be typed in a float more, expect for period in full years, which is the integer - this means no opportunity to calculate decimal periods like 2.5 years or 5.75 years as the intention was to calculate the values on a stronly full cycle.
After typing out data, the wizard will ask if you want to have interest rate compounded periodically. Press the relevent key to choose the recurrency value; otherwise, for simple interest rate, press A to have it compounded annually.
The utility will present both present and future values even when values are equal to 0. No negative values considered.

If you have any ideas or suggestions regarding the source code or functionality, feel free to leave a pull request or email me at mataleves@gmail.com with a subject line "Finn The Accountant Request" and I'll do my best to review your request.

Have fun with your financial assistance =)
